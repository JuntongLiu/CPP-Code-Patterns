# CPP-Code-Patterns
## This repository contains some code-patterns.

 Design pattern can be roughly divided into 3 categories:
 
      Behavioral     ---- Behavioral design patterns that focus on the interactions and communication between objects concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
      Creational     ---- Creational design patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
      Structural     ---- structural patterns are used to describe how objects can be composed to form larger structures while keeping the individual objects and their relationships intact.
